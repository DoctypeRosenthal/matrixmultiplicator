A simple matrices calculator which can execute calculations based on user input.
It includes a very basic React-like view renderer which can interprete a markup language based on objects and arrays (https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html). 
It implements the redux architecture (http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/CoreConcepts.html) to handle its state. 
time-travel is also possible (undo/redo).
